# Random parkrun stats

Jupyter notebooks for some parkrun stats.

Code is horrible, wanted answers quickly so copilot to the rescue. Got it here so I can come back and clean it up later ğŸ˜… and have a starting point for more things.

### alberts_1_10.ipynb 

I ran the 1st Albert's farm parkrun and 10 years later on the anniversary, I wanted to see who else did the same. Turns out 8 and only 2 went quicker (not me ğŸ˜…).
